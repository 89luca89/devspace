You can configure certain behaviours of DevSpace Cloud in the Admin -> Settings tab. 

## License

In the license tab you see your current license (if you have any), how long it is still valid and what your license limits are. To change your license, enter the license code into the key field.

> Changing a license can take up to 15 minutes 

## SMTP Settings

In this section you can configure the SMTP settings that will be used to send emails to reset forgotten passwords or confirming email addresses. Please make sure you fill out every field correctly, so that DevSpace Cloud is able to send emails with those credentials
