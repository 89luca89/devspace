## Loft Plugin For Teams
If you plan to use DevSpace with your team, make sure to check out [www.loft.sh](https://loft.sh) and the Loft plugin for DevSpace, which you can install using this command:
```bash
devspace add plugin https://github.com/loft-sh/loft-devspace-plugin
```

Loft allows you to efficiently share Kubernetes clusters with a large number of engineers rather than letting everyone set up their own cluster and having to struggle to manage and administrate it on their own.

Installing the Loft plugin will add commands like these to DevSpace:
```bash
devspace login                        # to login to Loft via DevSpace
devspace create space my-namespace    # for creating namespace on-demand via Loft
devspace create vcluster my-vcluster  # for creating virtual Kubernetes clusters via Loft
```
