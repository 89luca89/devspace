Functions are bash functions that can be called inside the remainder of `devspace.yaml`. A common use case is to define reusable functionality that is called from within the scripts you specify within the `pipelines` section.

There are two types of functions:
1. [Custom Functions](#built-in-functions) defined in `devspace.yaml` (often added via [`imports`](../imports/basics.mdx))
2. [Built-In Functions](#built-in-functions)

## Workflow

### 1. Define Functions
<ConfigPartial/>

### 2. Call Functions


## Built-In Functions
DevSpace provides a set of built-in functions. There are two types of functions:
1. [Pipeline-Only Functions](#pipeline-only-functions)
2. [Global Functions](#global-functions)

### Pipeline-Only Functions
Pipeline-only functions can only be used inside the scripts within the `pipelines` section of `devspace.yaml`.

### Global Functions
Global functions can be used anywhere in `devspace.yaml`, either in config fields that expect a bash script such as within `functions` or using [`$(command)` vars](../variables/command.mdx) in any other config field.
