</summary>

RebuildStrategy is used to determine when DevSpace should rebuild an image. By default, devspace will
rebuild an image if one of the following conditions is true:
- The dockerfile has changed
- The configuration within the devspace.yaml for the image has changed
- A file within the docker context (excluding .dockerignore rules) has changed
This option is ignored for custom builds.
