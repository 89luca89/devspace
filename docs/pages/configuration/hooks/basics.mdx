DevSpace allows you to define certain actions that should be executed during the pipeline. This makes it possible to customize the deployment and development process with DevSpace. The following actions can be executed with hooks:
- Execute a command on the local machine (in a golang shell or directly on the system)
- Execute a command in a container
- Upload a file or folder into a container
- Download a file or folder from a container
- Wait for a container to start or terminate
- Print the logs of container

Hooks can be defined in the `hooks` section of `devspace.yaml`:
```yaml
hooks:
# Execute the hook in a golang shell (cross operating system compatible)
- command: "echo before image building"
  events: ["before:build"]
# Execute the hook in a golang shell (cross operating system compatible)
- command: |
    echo Built Image image(image-1):tag(image-1)
  events: ["after:build:image-1"]
# Execute the hook directly on the system (echo binary must exist)
- command: "echo"
  args: ["before image building"]
  events: ["before:build:image-1", "before:build:image-2"]
# Execute the hook only on windows
- command: "echo before each image"
  os: windows
  events: ["before:build:*"]
```

This tells DevSpace to execute the command `echo before image building` before any image will be built. 

## Lifecycle Events  

You are able to define hooks for the following lifecycle events:
- `before:deployAll`, `after:deployAll`, `before:deploy:[name]`, `after:deploy:[name]`, `error:deploy:[name]`, `skip:deploy:[name]`: executed while DevSpace deploys `deployments`. `[name]` can be replaced with the config name of a deployment or `*` to match all.
- `before:renderAll`, `after:renderAll`, `before:render:[name]`, `after:render:[name]`, `error:render:[name]`: executed while DevSpace renders `deployments` during `devspace render`. `[name]` can be replaced with the config name of a deployment or `*` to match all.
- `before:purgeAll`, `after:purgeAll`, `before:purge:[name]`, `after:purge:[name]`, `error:purge:[name]`: executed while DevSpace purges `deployments` during `devspace purge`. `[name]` can be replaced with the config name of a deployment or `*` to match all.
- `before:buildAll`, `after:buildAll`, `before:build:[name]`, `after:build:[name]`, `error:build:[name]`, `skip:build:[name]`: executed while DevSpace builds `images`. `[name]` can be replaced with the config name of an image or `*` to match all.
- `start:sync:[name]`, `stop:sync:[name]`, `error:sync:[name]`, `restart:sync:[name]`, `before:initialSync:[name]`, `after:initialSync:[name]`, `error:initialSync:[name]`: executed while DevSpace syncs files with `dev.sync`. `[name]` can be replaced with the config name of a sync configuration or `*` to match all.
- `start:portForwarding:[name]`, `restart:portForwarding:[name]`, `error:portForwarding:[name]`, `stop:portForwarding:[name]`: executed while DevSpace port forwards with `dev.ports`. `[name]` can be replaced with the config name of a port forwarding configuration or `*` to match all.
- `start:reversePortForwarding:[name]`, `restart:reversePortForwarding:[name]`, `error:reversePortForwarding:[name]`, `stop:reversePortForwarding:[name]`: executed while DevSpace reverse port forwards with `dev.ports`. `[name]` can be replaced with the config name of a port forwarding configuration or `*` to match all.
- `before:createAllPullSecrets`, `after:createAllPullSecrets`, `error:createAllPullSecrets`: executed while DevSpace creates `pullSecrets`
- `devCommand:before:sync`, `devCommand:after:sync`, `devCommand:before:portForwarding`, `devCommand:after:portForwarding`, `devCommand:before:replacePods`, `devCommand:after:replacePods`, `devCommand:before:runPipeline`, `devCommand:after:runPipeline`, `devCommand:before:deployDependencies`, `devCommand:after:deployDependencies`, `devCommand:before:build`, `devCommand:after:build`, `devCommand:before:deploy`, `devCommand:after:deploy`: executed at certain lifecycle events during the `devspace dev` command

:::info Errors in Hooks
If any hook returns a non zero exit code, DevSpace will abort and print an error message.
:::

For `error:` events the actual error will be passed to the hook via the environment variable `DEVSPACE_HOOK_ERROR`. For example:
```yaml
# This will print the error to the console that has occured during a deployment
hooks:
- events: ["error:deploy:*"]
  command: "echo The following error has occurred: $DEVSPACE_HOOK_ERROR"
  os: darwin,windows
```

## Execute hooks in a container

DevSpace allows you to execute commands directly in a container instead of the local system. You can specify this in the `container` section of the hook:

```yaml
...
hooks:
- command: |
    echo Hello World!
    echo From within the container!
  container:
    imageSelector: nginx
    # Or select via labelSelector etc.
    # labelSelector: ...
    # namespace: ...
    # containerName: ...
    # pod: ...
  events: ["after:deploy:my-deployment"]
...
```

By default, DevSpace will wait for all pods / containers that were selected with the given selector to come up. As soon as all targets are running, DevSpace will execute the hook and wait for it to finish. You can define if DevSpace should wait and how long it should wait with `wait` and `timeout`:

```yaml
...
hooks:
- command: "echo"
  args: ["Hello from within the container!"]
  container:
    imageSelector: image(app):tag(app)
    # Or select via labelSelector etc.
    # labelSelector: ...
    # namespace: ...
    # containerName: ...
    # pod: ...
    wait: true   # This is the default
    timeout: 300 # Timeout in seconds
  events: ["after:deploy:my-deployment"]
...
```

## Upload or Download files from a container

Hooks can be used to upload or download files from a container. In the background, DevSpace will basically do a `kubectl cp` to the specified container. Example:
```yaml
hooks:
# Upload the complete local bin folder to the container path ./bin
- upload:
    localPath: bin
    containerPath: bin
  container:
    imageSelector: image(test):tag(test)
  events: ["after:deploy:my-deployment"]
# Download a single file from the container to the local path
- download:
    localPath: build/artifact.jar
    containerPath: /abs/path/build/artifact-test.jar
  container:
    imageSelector: image(java):tag(java)
  events: ["after:deploy:my-deployment-2"]
```

## Wait for a pod to be running

This hook action can be useful if you want to ensure a certain pod is running before you continue with the pipeline. An example configuration could look like this:
```yaml
...
deployments:
- name: my-database
  helm:
    componentChart: true
    values:
      ...
hooks:
# This hook will ensure that everytime the deployment
# my-database is deployed that DevSpace will wait until
# all pods and containers that match the labelSelector
# app.kubernetes.io/component: my-database are running
- wait:
    # DevSpace will wait for all containers that match the label selector below to become running. 
    # If there are init containers, make sure to set terminatedWithCode as well.
    running: true
    # This can be needed if there are for example init containers
    # that terminate instead of become running.
    terminatedWithCode: 0
  container:
    labelSelector:
      app.kubernetes.io/component: my-database
      # You could also select just a specific container with
      # containerName: database-container
  events: ["after:deploy:my-database"]
...
```

## Print the logs of a container 

This action can be useful to print logs of jobs or print the logs of init containers that would not be printed otherwise during `devspace dev`. An example configuration could look like this:

`job.yaml`:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-pod
  labels:
    app.kubernetes.io/component: my-job
spec:
  restartPolicy: Never
  containers:
    - command: ["sh"]
      args: ["-c", "echo 'Job Start' && sleep 5 && echo 'Doing Things...' && sleep 5 && echo 'Job End'"]
      image: alpine
      name: job
```

`devspace.yaml`:
```yaml
version: ...
deployments:
- name: my-job
  kubectl:
    manifests:
    - job.yaml
hooks:
# This hook will wait until the selected container is either running or already  
# terminated and then print the logs of it until it terminates.
- logs: {}
  container:
    labelSelector:
      app.kubernetes.io/component: my-job
  events: ["after:deploy:my-job"]
```

## Execute hooks in the background

By default, DevSpace will wait for a hook to finish and then move on with the pipeline. However, in some cases it might be desired that a hook is executed in the background to speed up a process. You can specify a background hook with the `background` option:

```yaml
...
hooks:
- command: "sh"
  args: ["-c", "sleep 10 && echo 'Hello, I was run inside the background!'"]
  background: true
  events: ["after:deploy"]
...
```

If you do not want to stream the output of the hook to the console, you can also mark the hook as silent, which will prevent any hook output:
```yaml
...
hooks:
- command: "sh"
  args: ["-c", "sleep 10 && echo 'Hello, I was run inside the background!'"]
  background: true
  silent: true
  events: ["after:deploy"]
...
```

## Execute hooks only on certain operating systems

Hooks can be executed only on certain operating systems:

```yaml {3,6}
hooks:
- command: echo before image building on windows
  os: windows
  events: ["after:build"]
- command: echo before image building on mac and linux
  os: darwin,linux
  events: ["after:build"]
```

## Hook Context Information

DevSpace passes certain environment variables to the hook execution:
- **DEVSPACE_HOOK_KUBE_CONTEXT**: the name of the kube context that was used
- **DEVSPACE_HOOK_KUBE_NAMESPACE**: the name of the kube namespace that was used
- **DEVSPACE_HOOK_OS_ARGS**: json encoded os.Args that were used to call devspace
- **DEVSPACE_HOOK_ERROR**: if an error has occured contains the error string (only for onError hooks)
