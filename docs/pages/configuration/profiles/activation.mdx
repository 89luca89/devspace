title: "Profiles: Activation"
sidebar_label: activation

The `activation` option is optional and allows you to activate a profile using regular expression matching of environment variables. An activation is configured with the profile it activates in `devspace.yaml`.

#### Example: Defining a Profile Activation
```yaml {3-5}
profiles:
- name: production
  activation:
  - env:
      ENV: "production"
  patches:
  - op: replace
    path: images.backend.image
    value: john/prodbackend
```
The `production` profile would be activated when the environment variable `ENV` has value `production`:

#### Example: Regular Expression Activation
```yaml {3-5}
profiles:
- name: production
  activation:
  - env:
      ENV: "prod-\d+"
  patches:
  - op: replace
    path: images.backend.image
    value: john/prodbackend
```
The profile `production` would be activated when the environment variable `ENV` matches the regular expression `prod-\d+`. This can be useful for matching environment variables that have dynamic values. Regular expressions will have start of string (`^`) and end of string (`$`) anchors added automatically to avoid unexpected substring matching. 

#### Example: Matching All Environment Variables
When multiple `env` name/expression pairs are specified in the same activation, all environment variables values must match the expression to activate the profile. For example, the `production` profile is activated when both environment variables match their expressions:
```yaml {3-6}
profiles:
- name: production
  activation:
  - env:
      CI: "true"
      ENV: "development"
  patches:
  - op: replace
    path: images.backend.image
    value: john/devbackend
```

#### Example: Matching Any Environment Variables
When environment variables are used in multiple activations, the profile is activated when any environment variable matches. In this example, the `production` profile is activated when either environment variables match their expressions:
```yaml {3-7}
profiles:
- name: production
  activation:
  - env:
      CI: "true"
  - env:
      ENV: "development"
  patches:
  - op: replace
    path: images.backend.image
    value: john/devbackend
```

### Dependency Activations
When `dependencies` are referenced from a `devspace.yaml`, the dependency's profile activations will also be evaluated. In this example, any profile activations in `./component-1/devspace.yaml` or `./component-2/devspace.yaml` would be evaluated.

```yaml
dependencies:
- name: component-1
  source:
    path: ./component-1
- name: component-2
  source:
    path: ./component-2
```

#### Example: Disable Activations by Dependency
The `disableProfileActivation` option can be used to disable profile activations for specific dependencies. In the following example, the activations for `./component-1/devspace.yaml` would be ignored, while the activations in `./component-2/devspace.yaml` would be evaluated:
```yaml {5}
dependencies:
- name: component-1
  source:
    path: ./component-1
  disableProfileActivation: true
- name: component-2
  source:
    path: ./component-2
```

### Disable Activations Globally
The `--disable-profile-activation` flag can be used to disable all profile activations, including those specifed within each dependency's `devspace.yaml`.
