Pipelines in DevSpace consists of one or more jobs that are run in parallel and can depend on each other. Each job consists of one or more conditional steps that are executed in order.

An example `pipelines` section could look like this in `devspace.yaml`:
```yaml
# File: devspace.yaml
pipelines:
  dev: |
    run_dependency_pipelines --all    # 1. Deploy any projects this project needs (see "dependencies")
    create_deployments --all          # 2. Deploy Helm charts and manifests specfied as "deployments"
    start_dev app                     # 3. Start dev mode "app" (see "dev" section)
  deploy: |
    run_dependency_pipelines --all                    # 1. Deploy any projects this project needs (see "dependencies")
    build_images --all -t $(git describe --always)    # 2. Build, tag (git commit hash) and push all images (see "images")
    create_deployments --all                          # 3. Deploy Helm charts and manifests specfied as "deployments"
  build: |
    build_images --all -t $(git describe --always)
  custom: ...
```

Pipelines can:
- Call built-in functions such as `build_images`, `create_deployments` or `start_dev`
- Call functions defined in `devspace.yaml` or in any `import`
- Use bash-like syntax including `if []; then ... fi`, `&&`, `||` or `;`
- Access environment variables and DevSpace variables

Pipelines are invoked via:
```bash
devspace run-pipeline [name]
```

:::info Cross-Platform Execution
Write all pipeline scrips in `bash` fashion. DevSpace is using a library to make them cross-platform executable.
