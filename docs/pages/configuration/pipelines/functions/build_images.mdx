The function `build_images` builds either all images (`--all` flag) or the images provided as arguments (e.g. `build_images api ui`). Images are, by default, processed in parallel.

## Arguments

### `--image`

The image you want to have built.

### Usage

```
build_image "image1" "image2"

```

## Flags

By default, flags are disabled. If a flag is enabled, the following action is taken.

### `--all`

All images will be built.

### `--tag / -t`

The build image tag will be returned.

### `--skip-build`

The image will not be built.

### `--skip-push`

The image will not be pushed to a container.

### `--skip-push-on-local-kubernetes`

The image will not be pushed to a local kubernetes cluster.

### `--force-rebuild`

The images will be rebuilt.

### `--sequential`

Images will be built in sequential order, one after another.

### `--max-concurrent-builds`

An integer that represents the maximum number of images that can be built concurrently.
