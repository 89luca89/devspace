title: Skip Image Push
sidebar_label: skipPush

## `skipPush`
The `skipPush` option expects a boolean value stating if pushing the image to a registry should be skipped during the build process.

If DevSpace is using a local Kubernetes cluster, pushing images might not be necessary because the image might already be accessible by Kubernetes via a local Docker daemon. In this case, it can make sense to speed up the process by setting `skipPush` to `true`.

:::info Auto-Enabled for Minikube & Docker Desktop
DevSpace automatically skips image push for kube-contexts with the following names:
- `minikube`
- `docker-desktop`
- `docker-for-desktop`

This allows to keep `skipPush: false` for these local clusters which helps to keep the configuration reusable and independent of the kube-context, i.e. it makes it easier to switch between local and remote clusters.
:::

:::warning Remote Clusters
Setting this option means that the configuration cannot be used to deploy to remote clusters anymore, which makes it harder to switch between clusters and keep the configuration cluster-independent.

#### Default Value For `skipPush`
```yaml
skipPush: false
```

#### Example
```yaml {4}
images:
  backend:
    image: john/appbackend
    skipPush: true
    docker:
      preferMinikube: true
  frontend:
    image: john/appfrontend
    docker:
      preferMinikube: false
```
The above configration would only push the `frontend` image but not the `backend` image. To manually trigger image building and pushing for all images, run:
```bash
devspace build
```
