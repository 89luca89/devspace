If you wish to build images directly inside containers within your Kubernetes cluster, you can use a build tool called [kaniko](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/kaniko). Building Docker images with kaniko is about as fast as building images with a Docker daemon. The advantage, however, is that you do not need to install Docker which is especially useful in CI/CD environments. For a list of all configuration options, refer to the [Full Config Reference](../../configuration/reference#images-buildkaniko)

```yaml
images:
  default:
    image: dscr.io/username/image
    build:
      kaniko:
        cache: true
        insecure: false
        flags: []
        options:
          buildArgs:
            someArg: argValue
            anotherArg: anotherValue
```

The above config shows a couple of common options:
- kaniko uses layer caching by default which can be disabled by setting `cache: false`.
- If you want to push images to a registry with an invalid or self-signed certificate, you will need to set `insecure: true` to tell kaniko to push to this registry without checking the SSL certificate.
- DevSpace CLI also lets you pass flags for the kaniko command using the `flags` array. To change the cache directory, for example, you could specify `flags: ["--cache-dir", "/some/dir"]`. Append additional flags to the array if needed. For a full list of available flags, please refer to the [kaniko docs](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/kaniko#additional-flags).
- By default, DevSpace CLI uses `kaniko` as a fallback build tool when Docker is not running. You can disable this behavior by setting `disableFallback: false`.
- DevSpace CLI can pass certain configurations directly to the Docker daemon for building an image. Aside from `target`, the most commonly used option is `buildArgs`.
