DevSpace CLI works with all public or private Docker registry. The only thing you need to do is to login to those registries with the `docker login` command.

## Use Docker Hub
To use Docker Hub with DevSpace CLI, login to Docker Hub first:
```bash
docker login
```
Afterwards, you can use images of this format: `[DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME]/[IMAGE]:[TAG]`

## Use your another Docker registry
To use another hosted registry or even your own private Docker registry with DevSpace CLI, login to the registry first:
```bash
docker login [registry.tld]
```
Afterwards, you can use images of this format: `[registry.tld]/[USERNAME]/[IMAGE]:[TAG]`

> If you are using DevSpace Container Registry, you can simply login with `devspace login`. Learn more about [DevSpace Container Registry (dscr.io)](../../cloud/images/dscr-io).
