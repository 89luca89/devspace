Run the following command to add a predefined component to your deployments:
```bash
devspace add deployment [deployment-name] --component=[component-name]
```
After adding a component, you need to manually redeploy in order to start the newly added component together with the remainder of your deployments.
```bash
devspace deploy
```

## List of predefined components
DevSpace CLI provides the following predefined components:
- mariadb
- mongodb
- mysql
- postgres
- redis

## Example: Adding mysql
To add mysql as predefined component to your deployments, run this command:
```bash
devspace add deployment database --component=mysql
```

DevSpace CLI will ask a couple of questions before adding the component.
```bash
? Please specify the mysql version you want to use 5.7
? Please specify the mysql root password my-password-123
? Please specify the mysql database to create on image startup my_database
? Please specify the database size in Gi 5Gi
[done] âˆš Successfully added database as new deployment
```

After adding the mysql component as a deployment, your `devspace.yaml` will contain a section similar to this one:
```yaml
deployments:
- name: database
  component:
    containers:
    - image: mysql:5.7
      env:
      - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
        value: my-password-123
      - name: MYSQL_DATABASE
        value: my_database
      volumeMounts:
      - containerPath: /var/lib/mysql
        volume:
          name: mysql-data
          subPath: /mysql
    volumes:
    - name: mysql-data
      size: 5Gi
    service:
      name: mysql
      ports:
      - port: 3306
- ... # your previously defined deployments
```

> DevSpace CLI always **prepends** new components in the deployments array within your `devspace.yaml`, so that the components you need will be deployed before your application will be started.

After adding the mysql database component, you need to redeploy:
```bash
devspace deploy
```

Now, you will be able to access your mysql database from other containers within your Kubernetes namespace using the following connection variables:

| Connection Variable | Value |
| ---:|---|
| Host | `mysql` |
| Port | `3306` |
| Username | `root` |
| Password | `my-password-123` |
| Database | `my_database` |
| Connection String | `mysql://root:my-password-123@mysql:3306/my_database` |
