The `imageName` option expects a string with the name of an image from the `images` section of the `devspace.yaml`. Using `imageName` tells DevSpace to select the container based on the referenced image that was last built using DevSpace. 

:::info
You can convert a value in `imageName` to `imageSelector` by converting the value of `imageName` to `image(my-image):tag(my-image)`. For example, the image name `imageName: my-image` would be equal to the image selector: `imageSelector: image(my-image):tag(my-image)`. We encourage people to prefer `imageSelector` instead of `imageName`, because `imageSelector` is a lot more flexible and you can also select images that are not defined in `images`.

:::note
When you want to select a container with an image that is not defined in your `devspace.yaml`, you generally want to select the right pod using the [`imageSelector`](#imageselector) or [`labelSelector`](#labelselector).

You can also select an image from a dependency with `dependency1.image1`
