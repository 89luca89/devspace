The `imageSelector` option expects a string that specifies an image (e.g. `my-registry.com/lib/my-image:tag`) to select a target pod and container with. The newest running pod that has a container which matches this image will be selected by DevSpace.

In addition, you can also reference images from the `images` section in the `imageSelector` with:
- If the image in `imageSelector` matches a `images.*.image`, DevSpace will automatically append the latest built tag during runtime to the `imageSelector`.
- You can also let DevSpace resolve the target image and tag by using the helpers `image()` or `tag()`

For example:
```yaml
images: 
  app: 
    image: my-registry.com/lib/my-image
dev:
  ...
  # DevSpace will search for the newest pod with a container that
  # uses my-registry.com/lib/other-image:latest
  - imageSelector: my-registry.com/lib/other-image:latest
  # DevSpace will search for the newest pod with a container that
  # uses my-registry.com/lib/my-image:xxxxx (latest built tag by DevSpace)
  - imageSelector: my-registry.com/lib/my-image
  # DevSpace will search for the newest pod with a container that
  # uses my-registry.com/lib/my-image:custom-tag
  - imageSelector: image(my-registry.com/lib/my-image):custom-tag
  # DevSpace will search for the newest pod with a container that
  # uses my-registry.com/lib/my-image:custom-tag
  - imageSelector: image(app):custom-tag
  # DevSpace will search for the newest pod with a container that
  # uses my-registry.com/lib/my-image:xxxxx (latest built tag by DevSpace)
  - imageSelector: image(app):tag(app)
  # DevSpace will search for the newest pod with a container that
  # uses the image of app of dependency dep1 with the latest built tag by DevSpace
  - imageSelector: image(dep1.app):tag(dep1.app)
```
